Welcome to the Threads app clone project! This is a full-stack application that aims to replicate the core functionality of the Threads application. The project utilizes Next.js, Clerk, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience across a wide range of devices.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Utilizing Clerk, the app provides secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application.
- **Thread Creation:** Users can create threads to initiate discussions on various topics.
- **Thread Participation:** Users can engage in existing threads by posting comments and replies.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience from extra-large screens down to small mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** The project is built upon the Next.js framework, allowing for server-side rendering, improved performance, and easy routing.
- **Clerk:** Clerk is used for user authentication, enabling secure and streamlined login and registration processes.
- **MongoDB:** The MongoDB database is employed to store and manage thread data efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS handles the app's styling, providing utility classes that make designing responsive interfaces easier.
- **TypeScript:** TypeScript brings static typing to the project, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

## Getting Started

To run the Threads app clone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```cd threads```

Install the dependencies.
```npm install```

Rename the ```.env.local.example``` file to ```.env.local``` and provide the necessary API keys and configuration values as instructed in the examples.

Start the development server.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
